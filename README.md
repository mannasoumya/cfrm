Work in progress

## Some Notes:
<br>
### Optimal Strategy
<br>
A strategy is optimal when it can do no worse than tie against any oppponent.
<br>
### Roughly defining Regret at Each Decision Point
<br>
How much better would it have done over all the games so far if it had always played this one action at this decision, instead of choosing whatever mixture over actions that the strategy (not optimal always) said it to use.
<br>
### Nash Equilibrium
<br>
Set of strategies one for each player in the game.
